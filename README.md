# Java Chess
This is a Java implementation of the classic game of chess, coded entirely by me. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) and allows two players to play against each other,  on the same computer.

## Features
Some of the key features of this Java chess project include:

- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Two player mode, with local play options
- Support for standard chess rules, including en passant, castling, and promotion

## How to Play
To play Java chess, simply download the project files and run the Java executable. Once the game is launched, two players can play against each other, on the same computer.

## Conclusion
This Java chess project was a challenging and rewarding exercise in java programming and Java Swing GUI development. I hope that this implementation of chess will provide hours of entertainment to anyone who plays it.
